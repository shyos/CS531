This class is designed to introduce the students with the basic algorithm design techniques. In the first a third of the class incremental algorithm design, divide and conquer paradigm, probabilistic analysis will be discussed through well-known sorting algorithms. In the remaining part of the class greedy algorithms, dynamic programming, network flows, NP-completeness, linear programming and a brief introduction to approximation algorithms will be covered.
