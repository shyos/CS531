This repo contains Homeworks and Solutions of CS531(BÄ°L531) lecture of TOBB ETU at Spring 2018.

Since, I have completed the class, now I decided to publish my solutions. Directly copying from this repository might give you trouble! and its also not an honorable act.

Here are the grades for my submissions:
HW1 - 25/30
HW4 - 37/37
HW5 - 53/55


## Course Description

This class is designed to introduce the students with the basic algorithm design techniques. In the first a third of the class incremental algorithm design, divide and conquer paradigm, probabilistic analysis will be discussed through well-known sorting algorithms. In the remaining part of the class greedy algorithms, dynamic programming, network flows, NP-completeness, linear programming and a brief introduction to approximation algorithms will be covered.
